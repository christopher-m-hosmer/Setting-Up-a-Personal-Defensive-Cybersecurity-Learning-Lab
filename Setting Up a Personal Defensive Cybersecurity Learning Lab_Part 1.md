Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document helps the user setup a hypervisor on a
[Microsoft Windows 10][Windows10-Support] host operating system (OS) and
a single virtual machine running the __Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)__
[Ubuntu Desktop Linux distribution][Ubuntu-Homepage] as a guest
operating system.  The document guides the user through installing
and configuring several publicly available U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) tools on the guest OS so the user can exercise self-learning to
evaluate the guest operating system's security posture and learn how to
securing the guest OS using U.S. DoD standards.

Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide provides directions for creating an environment that assists
a user in learning techniques used for securing the __Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)__
[Ubuntu Desktop Linux distribution][Ubuntu-Homepage] using U.S. DoD
tools and standards.  The guide does not cover how to use Linux, to
apply security principles, or to evaluate security standards within a
specific architecture.  It does help establish the environment needed
for the user to perform self-discovery about a commonly used Linux
distribution and the methods used by the U.S. DoD to both secure that
operating system and evaluate its security posture.  The objective is
for the user to exercise manual techniques, vs. automated scripts, to
step through each security control and apply the "Fix Text" so the user
can gain an understanding of each risk and the technical implementation
for mitigating the risk.  The user should read through each control
thoroughly researching each technology, the stated risk, and the impacts
of the fix text.  In the process the user will learn more about Linux,
how it works, and how to control its operational environment.

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document only covers setup of tools within
[Microsoft Windows 10][Windows10-Support] as the host operating system
(OS), i.e. the OS installed on the computer prior to following any of
the steps in this document.  This document also covers use of either
[Oracle VirtualBox][VB-Homepage] or
[VMware Workstation Player][VWP-Homepage] as the hypervisor;
[Oracle VirtualBox][VB-Homepage] is supported on a wider range of host
operating systems while [VMware Workstation Player][VWP-Homepage] is the
required hypervisor for [CyberPatriot][CP-Homepage] competitions.  Both
hypervisors are free to use, but [Oracle VirtualBox][VB-Homepage] has a
richer set of available features compared tp
[VMware Workstation Player][VWP-Homepage] so might be more desirable for
some users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> :warning: **CAUTION**
>>
>> Do not complete this section if you are going to complete the [General VMware Workstation Player Hypervisor and Virtual Machine Setup Steps](#general-vmware-workstation-player-hypervisor-and-virtual-machine-setup-steps) section.

01. [Download][VB-Downloads] the __VirtualBox__ platform package for Windows hosts (~103MB).

02. [Download][VB-Downloads] the __Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack__ for all supported platforms (~10.6MB).

03. Right-click the "SHA256 checksums" link and select the "Save link as" menu item.

04. In the file selection window, click the "Downloads" bookmark in the left pane, change the filename to `VirtualBox-SHA256SUMS.txt`, and click the "Save" button.

    > __Note__
    >
    > The "SHA256 checksums" is a text file, so left-clicking will open it within the browser instead of downloading and saving it to the default download directory.

05. [Download][Ubuntu-Downloads-18.04.6] the __Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS Desktop Linux__ distribution ISO image file (~2.3GB).

06. Right-click the "SHA256SUMS" link and select the "Save link as" menu item.

07. In the file selection window, click the "Downloads" bookmark in the left pane, change the filename to `Ubuntu18-SHA256SUMS.txt`, and click the "Save" button.

    > __Note__
    >
    > The "SHA256SUMS" is a text file, so left-clicking will open it within the browser instead of downloading and saving it to the default download directory.

08. Type `powershell` in the Windows Search Bar and start a `Windows PowerShell` session.

09. Navigate to the `Downloads` directory:

    ```powershell
    # Use a tilde-prefix to automatically insert the user's home directory as the first part of the path.
    cd ~\Downloads
    ```

10. Verify that the directory has the five (5) downloaded files:

    ```powershell
    # -Include: Only show the names that match the patterns
    Get-ChildItem .\* -Include '*VirtualBox*','*Ubuntu*'
    ```

11. Verify the __Integrity__ of the "VirtualBox" installer.

    01. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded "VirtualBox" installer:

        # .ToLower(): Convert the results to all lowercase
        (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\VirtualBox-*-Win.exe).Hash.ToLower()
        ```

        > __Note__
        >
        > If the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet is not available try using the `certutil` program:
        >
        > ```powershell
        > # The `certutil` application doesn't seem to accept glob patterns, so the full filename is required.
