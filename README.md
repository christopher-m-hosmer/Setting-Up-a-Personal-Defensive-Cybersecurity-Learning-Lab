Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These materials help a user setup tools such as hypervisors, virtual machines, and applications and then guides the user through installing and configuring several publicly available tools, such as those from the [U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/), so the user can exercise self-learning to evaluate the guest operating system's security posture and learn how to secure the guest OS using both U.S. DoD and third-party standards.  These materials may be useful to students trying to gain a better understanding of defensive Cybersecurity operations.

------------------------------------

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These materials are not meant to provide an exhaustive list of steps that the user should take to setup or use the environment.  The steps should provide just enough detail to assist while encouraging the user to conduct additional research to complete the tasks.
