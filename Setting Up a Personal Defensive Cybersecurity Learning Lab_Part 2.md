Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document helps the user setup a hypervisor on a
single virtual machine running the __Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)__
[Ubuntu Desktop Linux distribution][Ubuntu-Homepage] as a guest
operating system.  The document guides the user through installing
and configuring several publicly available U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) tools on the guest OS so the user can exercise self-learning to
evaluate the guest operating system's security posture and learn how to
securing the guest OS using U.S. DoD standards.

Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide provides directions for creating an environment that assists
a user in learning techniques used for securing the __Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)__
[Ubuntu Desktop Linux distribution][Ubuntu-Homepage] using U.S. DoD
tools and standards.  The guide does not cover how to use Linux, to
apply security principles, or to evaluate security standards within a
specific architecture.  It does help establish the environment needed
for the user to perform self-discovery about a commonly used Linux
distribution and the methods used by the U.S. DoD to both secure that
operating system and evaluate its security posture.  The objective is
for the user to exercise manual techniques, vs. automated scripts, to
step through each security control and apply the "Fix Text" so the user
can gain an understanding of each risk and the technical implementation
for mitigating the risk.  The user should read through each control
thoroughly researching each technology, the stated risk, and the impacts
of the fix text.  In the process the user will learn more about Linux,
how it works, and how to control its operational environment.

Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document does _not_ cover setup of tools within the
[Microsoft Windows 10][Windows10-Support] host operating system (OS),
i.e. the OS installed on the computer prior to following any of
the steps in this document.  Refer to [Setting Up a Personal Defensive Cybersecurity Learning Lab: Part 1](Late-Hours_Setting%20Up%20a%20Personal%20Defensive%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Lab_Part%201.html)

General VirtualBox Virtual Machine Setup Steps
------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> :warning: **CAUTION**
>>
>> Do not complete this section if you are going to complete the [General VMware Workstation Player Virtual Machine Setup Steps](#general-vmware-workstation-player-hypervisor-and-virtual-machine-setup-steps) section.

01. [Download][Ubuntu-Downloads-20.04] the __Ubuntu 20.04.x LTS Desktop Linux__ distribution ISO image file (~3GB).

02. Right-click the "SHA256SUMS" link and select the "Save link as" menu item.

03. In the file selection window, click the "Downloads" bookmark in the left pane, change the filename to `Ubuntu20-SHA256SUMS.txt`, and click the "Save" button.

    > __Note__
    >
    > The "SHA256SUMS" is a text file, so left-clicking will open it within the browser instead of downloading and saving it to the default download directory.

04. Type `powershell` in the Windows Search Bar and start a `Windows PowerShell` session.

05. Navigate to the `Downloads` directory:

    ```powershell
    # Use a tilde-prefix to automatically insert the user's home directory as the first part of the path.
    cd ~\Downloads
    ```

06. Verify that the directory has the two (2) downloaded files:

    ```powershell
    # -Include: Only show the names that match the patterns
    Get-ChildItem .\* -Include '*Ubuntu*'
    ```

07. Verify the __Integrity__ of the "Ubuntu 20.04.x LTS Desktop Linux" distribution ISO image file.

    01. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded "Ubuntu 20.04.x LTS Desktop Linux" distribution ISO image file:

        ```powershell
        # .Hash: Only return the hash value
        # .ToLower(): Convert the results to all lowercase
        (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\ubuntu-20.04.*-desktop-amd64.iso).Hash.ToLower()
        ```

        > __Note__
        >
        > If the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet is not available try using the `certutil` program:
        >
        > ```powershell
        > # The `certutil` application doesn't seem to accept glob patterns, so the full filename is required.
        > # The following command uses an example filename.
        > certutil -hashfile .\ubuntu-20.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso SHA256
        > ```

    02. Display the SHA-256 hash provided in the file downloaded from the "Ubuntu" website:

        ```powershell
        # |: Pipe the results of `Get-Content` into `Select-String`
        # -Pattern: Only return the strings that match the pattern
        # |: Pipe the results of `Select-String` into `ForEach-Object`
        # .Split: Split the string using the specified character as the field delimiter
        # [0]: Only return the first result
        Get-Content .\Ubuntu20-SHA256SUMS.txt | Select-String -Pattern 'ubuntu-20.04.*-desktop-amd64.iso' | ForEach-Object { ([string]$_).Split(' ')[0] }
        ```

    ```text
    SCC_5.4.2_Checksums.txt
    U_STIGViewer_2-16_Hashes.txt
    scc-5.4.2_ubuntu18_amd64_bundle.zip
    U_CAN_Ubuntu_20-04_LTS_V1R2_STIG_SCAP_1-2_Benchmark.zip
    U_CAN_Ubuntu_20-04_LTS_V1R4_STIG.zip
    U_STIGViewer_2-16_Linux.zip
    ```

19. Click the "Activities" button in the upper-left corner of the "top bar" on the desktop and type "Terminal" in the search bar.

20. Click the "Terminal" icon.

21. Navigate to the `Downloads` directory:

    ```bash
    # Use a tilde-prefix to automatically insert the user's home directory as the first part of the path.
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

22. Verify that the directory has the same six (6) files viewed in the `Files` application:

    ```bash
    # -1: Display results in a single column
    # -X: Sort alphabetically by entry extension
    ls -1X
    ```

23. Verify the __Integrity__ of the "SCAP Compliance Checker" ZIP archive.

    01. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded "SCAP Compliance Checker" ZIP archive:

        ```bash
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'sha256sum' into 'cut'
        # -d: Use the specified character as the field delimiter
        # -f: Only display the first field
        sha256sum scc-*_ubuntu18_amd64_bundle.zip | cut -d ' ' -f 1
        ```

    02. Display the SHA-256 hash provided in the file downloaded from the "DoD Cyber Exchange" website:

        ```bash
        # -A: Display the # of lines after the match
        # -E: Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'grep' into 'grep'
        # -v: Display all ines that do not match
        # -E: Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'grep' into 'cut'
        # -d: Use the specified character as the field delimiter
        # -f: Only display the fifth field
        grep -A 1 -E 'scc-.+_ubuntu18_amd64_bundle.zip' SCC_*_Checksums.txt | grep -v -E 'scc-.+_ubuntu18_amd64_bundle.zip' | cut -d ' ' -f 5
        ```

    03. Compare the two hashes; if they match then the __Integrity__ of the download is confirmed, else repeat the previous steps to download the file again.

24. Verify the __Integrity__ of the "STIG Viewer" ZIP archive.

    01. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded "STIG Viewer" ZIP archive:

        ```bash
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'sha256sum' into 'cut'
        # -d: Use the specified character as the field delimiter
        # -f: Only display the first field
        sha256sum U_STIGViewer_*_Linux.zip | cut -d ' ' -f 1
        ```

    02. Display the SHA-256 hash provided in the file downloaded from the "DoD Cyber Exchange" website:

        ```bash
        # -A: Display the # of lines after the match
        # -E: Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'grep' into 'grep'
        # -i: Make the match string case insensitive
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'grep' into 'cut'
        # -d: Use the specified character as the field delimiter
        # -f: Only display the fifth field
        #  |: Pipe the results from 'cut' into 'tr'
        grep -A 3 -E 'U_STIGViewer_.+_Linux.zip' U_STIGViewer_*_Hashes.txt | grep -i 'SHA256' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]
        ```

    03. Compare the two hashes; if they match then the __Integrity__ of the download is confirmed, else repeat the previous steps to download the file again.

25. Close the "Terminal" application.

26. Close the "Files" application.

27. Close the "Firefox" browser.
